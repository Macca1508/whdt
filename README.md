# WHDT ( WhiteLabel Human Digital Twin )

WHDT is a framework for creating and managing human digital twins. It provides a set of tools and libraries to build, deploy, and maintain digital representations of individuals, enabling personalized experiences and interactions.

The name WHDT is inspired by [WLDT](https://github.com/wldt) (White Label Digital Twin), which is a framework for creating and managing general purpose digital twins. WHDT extends the concept to focus specifically on human digital twins, but takes inspiration from WLDT in parts of its design and uses it to ship a ready-to-use implementation.
